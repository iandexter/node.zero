  <BR>

  <BR>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.

  <BR>

  <BR>Write for example, &#145;The night is shattered
  <BR>and the blue stars shiver in the distance.&#146;

  <BR>

  <BR>The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.

  <BR>

  <BR>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
  <BR>I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.

  <BR>

  <BR>Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.
  <BR>I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.

  <BR>

  <BR>She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.
  <BR>How could one not have loved her great still eyes.

  <BR>

  <BR>Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
  <BR>To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.

  <BR>

  <BR>To hear immense night, still more immense without her.
  <BR>And the verse falls to the soul like dew to a pasture.

  <BR>

  <BR>What does it matter that my love could not keep her.
  <BR>The night is shattered and she is not with me.

  <BR>

  <BR>This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.
  <BR>My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.

  <BR>

  <BR>My sight searches for her as though to go to her.
  <BR>My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.

  <BR>

  <BR>The same night whitening the same trees.
  <BR>We, of that time, are no longer the same.

  <BR>

  <BR>I no longer love her, that&#146;s certain, but how I loved her.
  <BR>My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.

  <BR>

  <BR>Another&#146;s. She will be another&#146;s. Like my kisses before.
  <BR>Her voice. Her bright body. Her infinite eyes.

  <BR>

  <BR>I no longer love her, that&#146;s certain, but maybe I love her.
  <BR>Love is short, forgetting is so long.

  <BR>

  <BR>Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms
  <BR>my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.

  <BR>

  <BR>Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer
  <BR>and these the last verses that I write for her.
