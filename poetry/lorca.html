 <DIV class="title">Lament for Ignacio Sanchez Mejias</DIV>

 <DIV class="bodytext">

  <BR>1. <B>Cogida and death</b>

  <BR>

  <BR>At five in the afternoon.
  <BR>It was exactly five in the afternoon.
  <BR>A boy brought the white sheet
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>A frail of lime ready prepared
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>The rest was death, and death alone.

  <BR>

  <BR>The wind carried away the cottonwool
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>And the oxide scattered crystal and nickel
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>Now the dove and the leopard wrestle
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>And a thigh with a desolated horn
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>The bass-string struck up
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>Arsenic bells and smoke
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>Groups of silence in the corners
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>And the bull alone with a high heart!
  <BR>At five in the afternoon.
  <BR>When the sweat of snow was coming
  <BR>at five in the afternoon,
  <BR>when the bull ring was covered with iodine
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>Death laid eggs in the wound
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>At five in the afternoon.
  <BR>At five o&#146;clock in the afternoon.

  <BR>

  <BR>A coffin on wheels is his bed
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>Bones and flutes resound in his ears
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>Now the bull was bellowing through his forehead
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>The room was iridiscent with agony
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>In the distance the gangrene now comes
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>Horn of the lily through green groins
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>The wounds were burning like suns
  <BR>at five in the afternoon.
  <BR>At five in the afternoon.
  <BR>Ah, that fatal five in the afternoon!
  <BR>It was five by all the clocks!
  <BR>It was five in the shade of the afternoon!

  <BR><BR>

  <BR>2. <B>The Spilled Blood</b>

  <BR>

  <BR>I will not see it!

  <BR>

  <BR>Tell the moon to come,
  <BR>for I do not want to see the blood
  <BR>of Ignacio on the sand.

  <BR>

  <BR>I will not see it!

  <BR>

  <BR>The moon wide open.
  <BR>Horse of still clouds,
  <BR>and the grey bull ring of dreams
  <BR>with willows in the barreras.

  <BR>

  <BR>I will not see it!

  <BR>

  <BR>Let my memory kindle!
  <BR>Warm the jasmines
  <BR>of such minute whiteness!

  <BR>

  <BR>I will not see it!

  <BR>

  <BR>The cow of the ancient world
  <BR>passed har sad tongue
  <BR>over a snout of blood
  <BR>spilled on the sand,
  <BR>and the bulls of Guisando,
  <BR>partly death and partly stone,
  <BR>bellowed like two centuries
  <BR>sated with threading the earth.
  <BR>No.
  <BR>I will not see it!

  <BR>

  <BR>Ignacio goes up the tiers
  <BR>with all his death on his shoulders.
  <BR>He sought for the dawn
  <BR>but the dawn was no more.
  <BR>He seeks for his confident profile
  <BR>and the dream bewilders him
  <BR>He sought for his beautiful body
  <BR>and encountered his opened blood
  <BR>Do not ask me to see it!
  <BR>I do not want to hear it spurt
  <BR>each time with less strength:
  <BR>that spurt that illuminates
  <BR>the tiers of seats, and spills
  <BR>over the cordury and the leather
  <BR>of a thirsty multiude.
  <BR>Who shouts that I should come near!
  <BR>Do not ask me to see it!

  <BR>

  <BR>His eyes did not close
  <BR>when he saw the horns near,
  <BR>but the terrible mothers
  <BR>lifted their heads.
  <BR>And across the ranches,
  <BR>an air of secret voices rose,
  <BR>shouting to celestial bulls,
  <BR>herdsmen of pale mist.
  <BR>There was no prince in Sevilla
  <BR>who could compare to him,
  <BR>nor sword like his sword
  <BR>nor heart so true.
  <BR>Like a river of lions
  <BR>was his marvellous strength,
  <BR>and like a marble toroso
  <BR>his firm drawn moderation.
  <BR>The air of Andalusian Rome
  <BR>gilded his head
  <BR>where his smile was a spikenard
  <BR>of wit and intelligence.
  <BR>What a great torero in the ring!
  <BR>What a good peasant in the sierra!
  <BR>How gentle with the sheaves!
  <BR>How hard with the spurs!
  <BR>How tender with the dew!
  <BR>How dazzling the fiesta!
  <BR>How tremendous with the final
  <BR>banderillas of darkness!

  <BR>

  <BR>But now he sleeps without end.
  <BR>Now the moss and the grass
  <BR>open with sure fingers
  <BR>the flower of his skull.
  <BR>And now his blood comes out singing;
  <BR>singing along marshes and meadows,
  <BR>sliden on frozen horns,
  <BR>faltering soulles in the mist
  <BR>stumbling over a thousand hoofs
  <BR>like a long, dark, sad tongue,
  <BR>to form a pool of agony
  <BR>close to the starry Guadalquivir.
  <BR>Oh, white wall of Spain!
  <BR>Oh, black bull of sorrow!
  <BR>Oh, hard blood of Ignacio!
  <BR>Oh, nightingale of his veins!
  <BR>No.
  <BR>I will not see it!
  <BR>No chalice can contain it,
  <BR>no swallows can drink it,
  <BR>no frost of light can cool it,
  <BR>nor song nor deluge og white lilies,
  <BR>no glass can cover mit with silver.
  <BR>No.
  <BR>I will not see it!

  <BR><BR>

  <BR>3. <B>The Laid Out Body</b>

  <BR>

  <BR>Stone is a forehead where dreames grieve
  <BR>without curving waters and frozen cypresses.
  <BR>Stone is a shoulder on which to bear Time
  <BR>with trees formed of tears and ribbons and planets.

  <BR>

  <BR>I have seen grey showers move towards the waves
  <BR>raising their tender riddle arms,
  <BR>to avoid being caught by lying stone
  <BR>which loosens their limbs without soaking their blood.

  <BR>

  <BR>For stone gathers seed and clouds,
  <BR>skeleton larks and wolves of penumbra:
  <BR>but yields not sounds nor crystals nor fire,
  <BR>only bull rings and bull rings and more bull rings without walls.

  <BR>

  <BR>Now, Ignacio the well born lies on the stone.
  <BR>All is finished. What is happening! Contemplate his face:
  <BR>death has covered him with pale sulphur
  <BR>and has place on him the head of dark minotaur.

  <BR>

  <BR>All is finished. The rain penetrates his mouth.
  <BR>The air, as if mad, leaves his sunken chest,
  <BR>and Love, soaked through with tears of snow,
  <BR>warms itself on the peak of the herd.

  <BR>

  <BR>What is they saying? A stenching silence settles down.
  <BR>We are here with a body laid out which fades away,
  <BR>with a pure shape which had nightingales
  <BR>and we see it being filled with depthless holes.

  <BR>

  <BR>Who creases the shroud? What he says is not true!
  <BR>Nobody sings here, nobody weeps in the corner,
  <BR>nobody pricks the spurs, nor terrifies the serpent.
  <BR>Here I want nothing else but the round eyes
  <BR>to see his body without a chance of rest.

  <BR>

  <BR>Here I want to see those men of hard voice.
  <BR>Those that break horses and dominate rivers;
  <BR>those men of sonorous skeleton who sing
  <BR>with a mouth full of sun and flint.

  <BR>

  <BR>Here I want to see them. Before the stone.
  <BR>Before this body with broken reins.
  <BR>I want to know from them the way out
  <BR>for this captain stripped down by death.

  <BR>

  <BR>I want them to show me a lament like a river
  <BR>which will have sweet mists and deep shores,
  <BR>to take the body of Ignacio where it looses itself
  <BR>without hearing the double planting of the bulls.

  <BR>

  <BR>Loses itself in the round bull ring of the moon
  <BR>which feigns in its youth a sad quiet bull,
  <BR>loses itself in the night without song of fishes
  <BR>and in the white thicket of frozen smoke.

  <BR>

  <BR>I don&#146;t want to cover his face with handkerchiefs
  <BR>that he may get used to the death he carries.
  <BR>Go, Ignacio, feel not the hot bellowing
  <BR>Sleep, fly, rest: even the sea dies!

  <BR><BR>

  <BR>4. <B>Absent Soul</b>

  <BR>

  <BR>The bull does not know you, nor the fig tree,
  <BR>nor the horses, nor the ants in your own house.
  <BR>The child and the afternoon do not know you
  <BR>because you have dead forever.

  <BR>

  <BR>The shoulder of the stone does not know you
  <BR>nor the black silk, where you are shuttered.
  <BR>Your silent memory does not know you
  <BR>because you have died forever

  <BR>

  <BR>The autumn will come with small white snails,
  <BR>misty grapes and clustered hills,
  <BR>but no one will look into your eyes
  <BR>because you have died forever.

  <BR>

  <BR>Because you have died for ever,
  <BR>like all the dead of the earth,
  <BR>like all the dead who are forgotten
  <BR>in a heap of lifeless dogs.

  <BR>

  <BR>Nobody knows you. No. But I sing of you.
  <BR>For posterity I sing of your profile and grace.
  <BR>Of the signal maturity of your understanding.
  <BR>Of your appetite for death and the taste of its mouth.
  <BR>Of the sadness of your once valiant gaiety.

  <BR>

  <BR>It will be a long time, if ever, before there is born
  <BR>an Andalusian so true, so rich in adventure.
  <BR>I sing of his elegance with words that groan,
  <BR>and I remember a sad breeze through the olive trees.
