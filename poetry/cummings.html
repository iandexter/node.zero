 <DIV class="bodytext">

  <BR>voices to voices,lip to lip
  <BR>i swear(to noone everyone)constitutes
  <BR>undying;or whatever this and that petal confutes...
  <BR>to exist being a peculiar form of sleep

  <BR>

  <BR>what&#146;s beyond logic happens beneath will;
  <BR>nor can these moments be translated:i say
  <BR>that even after April
  <BR>by God there is no excuse for May

  <BR>

  <BR>-bring forth your flowers and machinery:sculpture and prose
  <BR>flowers guess and miss
  <BR>machinery is the more accurate, yes
  <BR>it delivers the goods,Heaven knows

  <BR>

  <BR>(yet are we mindful,though not as yet awake,
  <BR>of ourselves which shout and cling,being
  <BR>for a little while and which easily break
  <BR>in spite of the best overseeing)

  <BR>

  <BR>i mean that the blond abscence of any program
  <BR>except last and always and first to live
  <BR>makes unimportant what i and you believe;
  <BR>not for philosophy does this rose give a damn...

  <BR>

  <BR>bring on your fireworks,which are a mixed
  <BR>splendor of piston and of pistil;very well
  <BR>provided an instant may be fixed
  <BR>so that it will not rub,like any other pastel.

  <BR>

  <BR>(While you and i have lips and voices which
  <BR>are for kissing and to sing with
  <BR>who cares if some oneyed son for a bitch
  <BR>invents an instrument to measure Spring with?

  <BR>

  <BR>each dream nascitur,is not made...)
  <BR>why then to Hell with that:the other;this,
  <BR>since the thing perhaps is
  <BR>to eat flower and not to be afraid.


  <BR><BR>---------------------------------------------<BR>


  <BR>you shall above all things be glad and young
  <BR>For if you&#146;re young,whatever life you wear

  <BR>

  <BR>it will become you;and if you are glad
  <BR>whatever&#146;s living will yourself become.
  <BR>Girlboys may nothing more than boygirls need:
  <BR>i can entirely her only love

  <BR>

  <BR>whose any mystery makes every man&#146;s
  <BR>flesh put space on;and his mind take off time

  <BR>

  <BR>that you should ever think,may god forbid
  <BR>and (in his mercy) your true lover spare:
  <BR>for that way knowledge lies,the foetal grave
  <BR>called progress,and negation&#146;s dead undoom.

  <BR>

  <BR>I&#146;d rather learn from one bird how to sing
  <BR>than teach ten thousand stars how not to dance
