<DIV class="poem">

 <DIV class="title">Sunflower Sutra</DIV>

 <DIV class="bodytext">

  <BR>I walked on the banks of the tincan banana dock and
  <BR><DIV class="tab">sat down under the huge shade of a Southern
  <BR>Pacific locomotive to look at the sunset over the
  <BR>box house hills and cry.</DIV>

  <BR>Jack Kerouac sat beside me on a busted rusty iron
  <BR><DIV class="tab">pole, companion, we thought the same thoughts
  <BR>of the soul, bleak and blue and sad-eyed,
  <BR>surrounded by the gnarled steel roots of trees of
  <BR>machinery.</DIV>

  <BR>The oily water on the river mirrored the red sky, sun
  <BR><DIV class="tab">sank on top of final Frisco peaks, no fish in that
  <BR>stream, no hermit in those mounts, just ourselves
  <BR>rheumy-eyed and hungover like old bums
  <BR>on the riverbank, tired and wily.</DIV>

  <BR>Look at the Sunflower, he said, there was a dead gray
  <BR><DIV class="tab">shadow against the sky, big as a man, sitting
  <BR>dry on top of a pile of ancient sawdust--</DIV>

  <BR>--I rushed up enchanted--it was my first sunflower,
  <BR><DIV class="tab">memories of Blake--my visions--Harlem</DIV>

  <BR>and Hells of the Eastern rivers, bridges clanking Joes
  <BR><DIV class="tab">Greasy Sandwiches, dead baby carriages, black
  <BR>treadless tires forgotten and unretreaded, the
  <BR>poem of the riverbank, condoms &amp; pots, steel
  <BR>knives, nothing stainless, only the dank muck
  <BR>and the razor-sharp artifacts passing into the
  <BR>past--</DIV>

  <BR>and the gray Sunflower poised against the sunset,
  <BR><DIV class="tab">crackly bleak and dusty with the smut and smog
  <BR>and smoke of olden locomotives in its eye--</DIV>

  <BR>corolla of bleary spikes pushed down and broken like
  <BR><DIV class="tab">a battered crown, seeds fallen out of its face,
  <BR>soon-to-be-toothless mouth of sunny air, sunrays
  <BR>obliterated on its hairy head like a dried
  <BR>wire spiderweb,</DIV>

  <BR>leaves stuck out like arms out of the stem, gestures
  <BR><DIV class="tab">from the sawdust root, broke pieces of plaster
  <BR>fallen out of the black twigs, a dead fly in its ear,</DIV>

  <BR>Unholy battered old thing you were, my sunflower O
  <BR><DIV class="tab">my soul, I loved you then!</DIV>

  <BR>The grime was no man&#146;s grime but death and human
  <BR><DIV class="tab">locomotives,</DIV>

  <BR>all that dress of dust, that veil of darkened railroad
  <BR><DIV class="tab">skin, that smog of cheek, that eyelid of black
  <BR>mis&#146;ry, that sooty hand or phallus or protuberance
  <BR>of artificial worse-than-dirt--industrial--
  <BR>modern--all that civilization spotting your
  <BR>crazy golden crown--</DIV>

  <BR>and those blear thoughts of death and dusty loveless
  <BR><DIV class="tab">eyes and ends and withered roots below, in the
  <BR>home-pile of sand and sawdust, rubber dollar
  <BR>bills, skin of machinery, the guts and innards
  <BR>of the weeping coughing car, the empty lonely
  <BR>tincans with their rusty tongues alack, what
  <BR>more could I name, the smoked ashes of some
  <BR>cock cigar, the cunts of wheelbarrows and the
  <BR>milky breasts of cars, wornout asses out of chairs
  <BR>&amp; sphincters of dynamos--all these</DIV>

  <BR>entangled in your mummied roots--and you there
  <BR><DIV class="tab">standing before me in the sunset, all your glory
  <BR>in your form!</DIV>

  <BR>A perfect beauty of a sunflower! a perfect excellent
  <BR><DIV class="tab">lovely sunflower existence! a sweet natural eye
  <BR>to the new hip moon, woke up alive and excited
  <BR>grasping in the sunset shadow sunrise golden
  <BR>monthly breeze!</DIV>

  <BR>How many flies buzzed round you innocent of your
  <BR><DIV class="tab">grime, while you cursed the heavens of the
  <BR>railroad and your flower soul?</DIV>

  <BR>Poor dead flower? when did you forget you were a
  <BR><DIV class="tab">flower? when did you look at your skin and
  <BR>decide you were an impotent dirty old locomotive?
  <BR>the ghost of a locomotive? the specter and
  <BR>shade of a once powerful mad American locomotive?</DIV>

  <BR>You were never no locomotive, Sunflower, you were a
  <BR><DIV class="tab">sunflower!</DIV>

  <BR>And you Locomotive, you are a locomotive, forget me
  <BR><DIV class="tab">not!</DIV>

  <BR>So I grabbed up the skeleton thick sunflower and stuck
  <BR><DIV class="tab">it at my side like a scepter,</DIV>

  <BR>and deliver my sermon to my soul, and Jack&#146;s soul
  <BR><DIV class="tab">too, and anyone who&#146;ll listen,</DIV>

  <BR>--We&#146;re not our skin of grime, we&#146;re not our dread
  <BR><DIV class="tab">bleak dusty imageless locomotive, we&#146;re all
  <BR>beautiful golden sunflowers inside, we&#146;re blessed
  <BR>by our own seed &amp; golden hairy naked
  <BR>accomplishment-bodies growing into mad black
  <BR>formal sunflowers in the sunset, spied on by our
  <BR>eyes under the shadow of the mad locomotive
  <BR>riverbank sunset Frisco hilly tincan evening
  <BR>sitdown vision.</DIV>

  <BR>Berkeley, 1955
