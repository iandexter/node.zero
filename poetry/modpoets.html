  <BR>January. The archer aims at himself.
  <BR>His target is the eye of a fish. River
  <BR>is frozen. Field rises in mist of lost
  <BR>desire and steams the sealed sky open.
  <BR>Fish be ruby-weeping. Fish be nailed
  <BR>through scale onto door of silver birch.
  <BR>Over the mountain beaten boy searches
  <BR>for his teeth inside a clump of brambles.
  <BR>The sound of thorns through his skin
  <BR>is <I>mercy</I>. The sound of a beautiful fish
  <BR>being nailed to a door is <I>mercy, mercy</I>.
  <BR>Nobody knows the origin of music,
  <BR>or who wind pitches for between rock
  <BR>and rock like a bronco heart kicking
  <BR>in its cage. Breeze seduces bow. Bow
  <BR>abandons arrow. Boy finds shelter
  <BR>in thicket and hears music of his breath
  <BR>through ugly, twisted thistles. Come
  <BR>home. It&#146;s time to begin again. A boy
  <BR>is nailed to the door and a fish is aimed
  <BR>at an archer, mountain is weeping rubies
  <BR>onto frozen river while wind grinds
  <BR>two new teeth. Who are you
  <BR>inside the music of another&#146;s suffering?
  <BR>When I was a nail I loved only
  <BR>the hammer. When I was a breeze I died
  <BR>on a door. When I was a fish
  <BR>I swam without knowing not yet, or last
  <BR>breath, or shore.<BR><BR>

  <BR>I thought my life was
  <BR>my intelligence. But then a dimming overcame
  <BR>me,
  <BR>then a wind, and then the whole
  <BR>sound waveletted, aroused.
  <BR>I was extremely gradual in my
  <BR>misgiving, as I looked (for things did not
  <BR>look) up<IMG src="images/black.GIF" width="15" height="1" border="0" align="ABSMIDDLE">and there the buffeted
  <BR>high race of K&#146;s revealed, so that a man could
  <BR>see it for imself, the fabled column in the clouds
  <BR>(which heretofore I&#146;d only known
  <BR>from books): and it had one
  <BR>long eyehole through it
  <BR>to a blue too light
  <BR>to trust. (The lightest blue is heaven&#146;s kind
  <BR>of founding oxymoron.) It&#146;s not there
  <BR>for us to understand; it&#146;s there for us
  <BR>to be looked down on through...
  <BR>How clumsily I made my way
  <BR>upstairs from shore to cover<IMG src="images/black.GIF" width="15" height="1" border="0" align="ABSMIDDLE">
  <BR>where a forest took my thrashing for me.
  <BR>Still I&#146;d had my awful
  <BR>eyeful of the future, in which we
  <BR>are bearing up for life, while it
  <BR>bears down, a mind for legalism,
  <BR>slow. It has the time. (Forget
  <BR>your airs). It has the grounds.<BR><BR>

  <I><A name="SABINES">The Lovers</A></I>
  <BR>Jaime Sabines
  <BR>(trans. W.S. Merwin)
 </DIV>

 <DIV class="bodytext">
  <BR>The lovers say nothing.
  <BR>Love is the finest of silences,
  <BR>the one that trembles most and is the hardest
  <BR>to bear.
  <BR>The lovers are looking for something.
  <BR>The lovers are the ones who abandon,
  <BR>the ones who change, who forget.
  <BR>Their hearts tell them that they will never find.
  <BR>They don&#146;t find, they&#146;re looking.
  <BR>The lovers wander around like crazy
  <BR>people
  <BR>because they&#146;re alone, alone,
  <BR>surrendering, giving themselves to each moment,
  <BR>crying because they don&#146;t save love.
  <BR>They worry about love. The lovers
  <BR>live for the day, it&#146;s the best they can do, it&#146;s all
  <BR>they know.
  <BR>They&#146;re going away all the time,
  <BR>all the time, going somewhere else.
  <BR>They hope,
  <BR>not for anything in particular, they just hope.
  <BR>They know that whatever it is, they will not find it.
  <BR>Love is the perpetual deferment,
  <BR>always the next step, the other, the other.
  <BR>The lovers are the insatiable ones,
  <BR>the ones who must always, fortunately, be alone.
  <BR>The lovers are the serpents in the story.
  <BR>They have snakes instead of arms.
  <BR>The veins in their necks swell
  <BR>like snakes too, suffocating them.
  <BR>The lovers can&#146;t sleep
  <BR>because if they do the worms eat them.
  <BR>They open their eyes in the dark
  <BR>and terror falls into them.
  <BR>They find scorpions under the sheet
  <BR>and their beds float as though on a lake.
  <BR>The lovers are crazy, only crazy
  <BR>with no God and no devil.
  <BR>The lovers come out of their caves
  <BR>trembling, starving,
  <BR>chasing phantoms.
  <BR>They laugh at those who know all about it,
  <BR>who love forever, truly,
  <BR>at those who believe in love as an
  <BR>inexhaustible lamp.
  <BR>The lovers play at picking up water,
  <BR>tatooing smoke, at staying where they are.
  <BR>They play the long sad game of love.
  <BR>None of them will give up.
  <BR>The lovers are afraid to reach any
  <BR>agreement.
  <BR>Empty, but empty from one rib to another,
  <BR>death ferments them behind the eyes,
  <BR>and on they go, they weep toward morning
  <BR>in the trains, and the roosters wake into sorrow.
  <BR>Sometimes a scent of
  <BR>newborn earth reaches them,
  <BR>of women sleeping with a
  <BR>hand on their sex,
  <BR>contented,
  <BR>of gentle streams, and
  <BR>kitchens.
  <BR>The lovers start singing
  <BR>between their lips
  <BR>a song that is not learned.
  <BR>And they go on crying, crying
  <BR>for beautiful life.<BR><BR>

  <BR>What we live
  <BR>before the light is turned off
  <BR>is what prevents the light from being
  <BR>turned off.
  <BR>In the marrow, in the nerve in
  <BR>nightgowned exhaustion,
  <BR>to secure the heart,
  <BR>hoping my intention whole, I leave
  <BR>nothing
  <BR>behind, drag nakedness to the brisker
  <BR>air of the garden.
  <BR>What the sweeper has not swept
  <BR>gathers
  <BR>to delay all my striving. But here I arrive
  <BR>with the first stars: the flame in each
  <BR>hanging like a trophy in the lull just
  <BR>before
  <BR>the hours, those antagonists
  <BR>that haunt and confiscate
  <BR>what the hardware of slumber draws
  <BR>below.

  <BR>

  <BR>Night sky,
  <BR>all day the light
  <BR>responding without proof, vigorously
  <BR>embraced blue,
  <BR>lavender-sucking bees,
  <BR>a stone spewing water to golden carp.
  <BR>Light piled on indisputable light rekindled bits
  <BR>of garden
  <BR>until bare-shouldered, coherent, each root,
  <BR>its stem,
  <BR>each petal and leaf
  <BR>regained its original name
  <BR>just as your door opened and we had to go
  <BR>through.
  <BR>Which is to know your returned darkness
  <BR>was born first
  <BR>with all its knowledge<IMG src="images/black.GIF" width="15" height="1" border="0" align="ABSMIDDLE">
  <BR>routine in the settling down, little thumps
  <BR>like someone knocking at the temple<IMG src="images/black.GIF" width="15" height="1" border="0" align="ABSMIDDLE">
  <BR>arriving
  <BR>within each soul growing old
  <BR>begging, impatient
  <BR>for those nights to end, wanting
  <BR>never darkness<IMG src="images/black.GIF" width="15" height="1" border="0" align="ABSMIDDLE">
  <BR>its murmurous mirror:

  <BR>

  <BR>its drained tongue
  <BR>as dead driftwood soaking the vein
  <BR>as these words float up
  <BR>out of body
  <BR>in a joke sharpened in or sharpening
  <BR>each myopic minute
  <BR>met
  <BR>and now dirtied up, or far too beautiful
  <BR>for this
  <BR>and now desperate for
  <BR>the never would or could
  <BR>or at least had not meant to mean). Pity the stirred.
  <BR>So stormed out, as in exhausted, my eardrums left
  <BR>watching.
  <BR>Each nerve, in the mood exhumed,
  <BR>hissing, go away,
  <BR>go away, might sky, did we come this far together?
  <BR>I am cold. And in this next breath,
  <BR>the same waking,
  <BR>the same hauling of debris. I am
  <BR>here in the skin of...otherwise) shoveling out, dryly<BR><BR>
