 <DIV class="title">The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</DIV>

 <DIV class="bodytext">

  <I>
  <BR>S&#146;io credesse che mia risposta fosse
  <BR>A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,
  <BR>Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.
  <BR>Ma perciocche giammai di questo fondo
  <BR>Non torno vivo alcun, s&#146;i&#146;odo il vero,
  <BR>Senza tema d&#146;infamia ti rispondo.
  </I>

  <BR><BR>

  <BR>LET us go then, you and I,
  <BR>When the evening is spread out against the sky
  <BR>Like a patient etherised upon a table;
  <BR>Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
  <BR>The muttering retreats
  <BR>Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
  <BR>And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
  <BR>Streets that follow like a tedious argument
  <BR>Of insidious intent
  <BR>To lead you to an overwhelming question...
  <BR>Oh, do not ask, &quot;What is it?&quot;
  <BR>Let us go and make our visit.

  <BR>

  <BR>In the room the women come and go
  <BR>Talking of Michelangelo.

  <BR>

  <BR>The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
  <BR>The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes
  <BR>Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
  <BR>Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
  <BR>Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
  <BR>Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
  <BR>And seeing that it was a soft October night,
  <BR>Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.

  <BR>

  <BR>And indeed there will be time
  <BR>For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
  <BR>Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;
  <BR>There will be time, there will be time
  <BR>To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
  <BR>There will be time to murder and create,
  <BR>And time for all the works and days of hands
  <BR>That lift and drop a question on your plate;
  <BR>Time for you and time for me,
  <BR>And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
  <BR>And for a hundred visions and revisions,
  <BR>Before the taking of a toast and tea.

  <BR>

  <BR>In the room the women come and go
  <BR>Talking of Michelangelo.

  <BR>

  <BR>And indeed there will be time
  <BR>To wonder, &quot;Do I dare?&quot; and, &quot;Do I dare?&quot;
  <BR>Time to turn back and descend the stair,
  <BR>With a bald spot in the middle of my hair--
  <BR>[They will say: &quot;How his hair is growing thin!&quot;]
  <BR>My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
  <BR>My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin--
  <BR>[They will say: &quot;But how his arms and legs are thin!&quot;]
  <BR>Do I dare
  <BR>Disturb the universe?
  <BR>In a minute there is time
  <BR>For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.

  <BR>

  <BR>For I have known them all already, known them all:--
  <BR>Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
  <BR>I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
  <BR>I know the voices dying with a dying fall
  <BR>Beneath the music from a farther room.
  <BR><DIV class="tab">So how should I presume?</DIV>

  <BR>And I have known the eyes already, known them all--
  <BR>The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
  <BR>And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
  <BR>When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
  <BR>Then how should I begin
  <BR>To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
  <BR><DIV class="tab">And how should I presume?</DIV>

  <BR>And I have known the arms already, known them all--
  <BR>Arms that are braceleted and white and bare
  <BR>[But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!]
  <BR>It is perfume from a dress
  <BR>That makes me so digress?
  <BR>Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.
  <BR><DIV class="tab">And should I then presume?
  <BR>And how should I begin?</DIV>

  .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
  <BR>Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets
  <BR>And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
  <BR>Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?...

  <BR>

  <BR>I should have been a pair of ragged claws
  <BR>Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.

  <BR>
  .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
  <BR>And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!
  <BR>Smoothed by long fingers,
  <BR>Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,
  <BR>Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.
  <BR>Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
  <BR>Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
  <BR>But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
  <BR>Though I have seen my head [grown slightly bald] brought in upon a platter,
  <BR>I am no prophet--and here&#146;s no great matter;
  <BR>I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
  <BR>And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
  <BR>And in short, I was afraid.

  <BR>

  <BR>And would it have been worth it, after all,
  <BR>After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
  <BR>Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
  <BR>Would it have been worth while,
  <BR>To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
  <BR>To have squeezed the universe into a ball
  <BR>To roll it toward some overwhelming question,
  <BR>To say: &quot;I am Lazarus, come from the dead,
  <BR>Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all&quot;--
  <BR>If one, settling a pillow by her head,
  <BR><DIV class="tab">Should say: &quot;That is not what I meant at all.
  <BR>That is not it, at all.&quot;</DIV>

  <BR>And would it have been worth it, after all,
  <BR>Would it have been worth while,
  <BR>After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
  <BR>After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor--
  <BR>And this, and so much more?--
  <BR>It is impossible to say just what I mean!
  <BR>But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:
  <BR>Would it have been worth while
  <BR>If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
  <BR>And turning toward the window, should say:
  <BR><DIV class="tab">&quot;That is not it at all,
  <BR>That is not what I meant, at all.&quot;</DIV>

  .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.
  <BR>No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;
  <BR>Am an attendant lord, one that will do
  <BR>To swell a progress, start a scene or two,
  <BR>Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,
  <BR>Deferential, glad to be of use,
  <BR>Politic, cautious, and meticulous;
  <BR>Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;
  <BR>At times, indeed, almost ridiculous--
  <BR>Almost, at times, the Fool.

  <BR>

  <BR>I grow old ... I grow old...
  <BR>I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.

  <BR>

  <BR>Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?
  <BR>I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.
  <BR>I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.

  <BR>

  <BR>I do not think that they will sing to me.

  <BR>

  <BR>I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
  <BR>Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
  <BR>When the wind blows the water white and black.

  <BR>

  <BR>We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
  <BR>By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
  <BR>Till human voices wake us, and we drown.
