# Primal Scream

## What is this sorcery?!

It's one of my early attempts at poetry *and* web design (TABLES!!!1). Hosted
in Tripod.com (remember that?), "Primal Scream" offered readers a glimpse at
the inner psyche of a 20-something angst-riddent me.

## Why?

Because... :-)

For posterity, of course. It's a good thing that Tripod is still up (heh) but
you'll never know when a site goes down. There's the Internet Archive, of
course, but having my own copy is better.

## Now what?

I did some cleanups, removed Tripod and Lycos (!!) ad script gunk. I also need
to make the pop-up side navigator working. Old Javascript is old.
